# Vercel 404 Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Vercel deployment was returning 404 errors because the Next.js build was failing due to:
1. Next.js 16.0.0 (Turbopack) had module resolution issues with UI components
2. Workspace root detection problems caused by multiple `package-lock.json` files
3. Missing `"use client"` directive in the Alert component

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files Updated

#### `next.config.js`
- Removed invalid `eslint` configuration (not supported in Next.js 16+)
- Set `trailingSlash: false` for better static export compatibility

#### `vercel.json`
- Removed `"framework": null` to allow Vercel to use Next.js optimizations
- Added `"cleanUrls": true` for better URL handling
- Set `"trailingSlash": false` to match Next.js config

### 2. Package Downgrade
- Downgraded from `next: 16.0.0` to `next: 15.1.3` (stable version)
- Next.js 16 is still in early release and has Turbopack issues

### 3. Component Fixes
- Added `"use client"` directive to `components/ui/alert.tsx`
- This ensures proper client-side rendering for interactive components

### 4. New Files Created
- `.vercelignore` - Prevents unnecessary files from being uploaded to Vercel
- `public/.gitkeep` - Ensures public directory exists for static assets

## Build Verification
The build now completes successfully:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages (4/4)
✓ Exporting (3/3)

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Redeploy on Vercel (Recommended)
1. Commit all changes to your repository:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/seanmcdonnell/Desktop/Mothership add ons/elca-blockbusters"
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel 404 errors - downgrade Next.js and fix config"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Vercel will automatically detect the push and redeploy
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for the deployment to complete
4. Visit your Vercel URL to verify the fix

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Vercel CLI
```bash
cd "/Users/seanmcdonnell/Desktop/Mothership add ons/elca-blockbusters/frontend"
npx vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Rebuild in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Deployments"
4. Click the three dots on the latest deployment
5. Click "Redeploy"

## Testing Locally
To test the build locally before deploying:
```bash
cd "/Users/seanmcdonnell/Desktop/Mothership add ons/elca-blockbusters/frontend"
npm run build
npx serve out
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` to verify the static export works correctly.

## Key Files Modified
- `frontend/next.config.js` - Removed invalid config, adjusted settings
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Fixed Vercel deployment configuration
- `frontend/package.json` - Downgraded Next.js to stable version
- `frontend/components/ui/alert.tsx` - Added "use client" directive
- `frontend/.vercelignore` - New file to optimize deployments
- `frontend/public/.gitkeep` - New file to ensure directory exists

## Technical Notes
- The issue was caused by Next.js 16's Turbopack bundler having module resolution problems
- Next.js 15.1.3 uses the stable webpack bundler which works correctly
- Static export (`output: 'export'`) is fully supported and working
- All API calls are properly proxied through Vercel's rewrites to the Render backend

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the changes to Vercel
2. Verify the frontend loads correctly
3. Test all three dashboards (Sermon Generator, Gen-Z Translator, Miracles Finder)
4. Verify API connectivity to the Render backend
5. Consider upgrading back to Next.js 16 once Turbopack issues are resolved (monitor Next.js releases)

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist, you can rollback by:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Support
If you encounter any issues after deployment:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs in the dashboard
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify the backend API is running on Render
4. Ensure environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
